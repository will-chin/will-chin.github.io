        //1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
        //2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
        //3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
        //4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

        //Example:
        //uncomment the code below. That is rule #1. Homework is to add rules #2-4 from this link:
        //https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
